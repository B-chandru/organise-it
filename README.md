Where you can organise all  the website's url that your are using regularly in one place.

let's see how it's works whenever you add any  website url .It detect's the url  and add the logo of it for example, if the url contains Github the anchor element  will be created with Github logo below .whenever you click on  that logo you will be redirected to that url .The value of that url  will be updated if  you add the same website url with different parameters.if you are not using the website anymore then you can delete it
